        <h1>Advanced Model Attempt I</h1>
        <p>We present an advanced model that builds upon our strawman models.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            Based on our error analysis from the strawman attempts and the
            feedback from our in-class presentation, we have refined our data
            collection process slightly:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reduced emotion palette</strong>: our emotion
                    tagger was not classifying "neutral" or "surprised" tweets
                    accurately enough to merit continuing to collect tweets in
                    either category. This is not unreasonable; it seems
                    unlikely that Twitter users would bother sending out a
                    status update if they were feeling completely neutral at
                    the moment!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Expanded corpus</strong>: in addition to reducing
                    our emotion palette, we also adjusted our emoji-emotion
                    mappings slightly, which has had a net effect of
                    streamlining our data collection process. We now have over
                    nine thousand tweets for each emotion!
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
