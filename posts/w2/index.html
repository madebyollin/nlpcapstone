        <h2>Question Answering with MSMarco<!--still in progress--></h2>
        <h3>Action Plan</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Implement and train a Pointer Network architecture as an
            attention mechanism as described by
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03134.pdf">Vinyals et al.</a>.
            </li>
            <li> Implement and train an RNN/LSTM architecture
            to generate answers using the output of the attention model.
            For example, <a hrev="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07905.pdf">Wang &amp; Jiang</a>.
            </li>
            <li> Open the domain to new inputs: Generate new training
            questions by crawling forums such as as Reddit, Quora,
            StackExchange, etc. for questions, and retrieving answer sources from a search
            engine.
            </li>
            <li> Make a user-friendly interface for the question-answering
            system.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Take advantage of MSMarco's "query type" annotations by making
            separate models for each query type. For example, "numeric" queries
            can be handled differently than "description" queries.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sentimental Speech Generation</h2>
        <h3>Action Plan</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Train a Multi-Class Sentiment Analyzer:</strong> This would be implemented using a vanilla LSTM unless we stumble upon a more exciting architecture, and would focus on classifying the emotions of {anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise}.  We can train on tweets containing emoji that correspond to those emotions (but with emoji removed).  We would likely use pre-trained Twitter word embeddings like GloVe.</li>
            <li><strong>Get an existing TTS System Running:</strong> Something like <a href="https://github.com/marytts/marytts">MaryTTS</a> would work.  Alternately, if there is a reasonable implementation of WaveNet, Deep Voice, or another more experimental architecture, this would be preferable.</li>
            <li><strong>Build a system to post-process TTS output according to sentiment:</strong> Initially, this would be hardcoded and applied per-sentence (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_prosody">lower pitch and a sharper attack for anger</a>, for example), but depending on the quality of speech-to-emotion datasets available we could train a more carefully parameterized model.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>More Nuanced Text Analysis:</strong> Sentence-level analysis of basic emotions is good, but more classes (i.e. whether the sentence is a question, an order, etc.) can provide more information to improve synthesis.  Furthermore, computing word-level scores rather than sentence-level scores might provide more subtle readings.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrate Sentiment Processing with TTS as Conditioning:</strong> If we can implement <a href="https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet/issues/112">local conditioning for TF-WaveNet</a>, for example, then we can train the speech synthesis model with emotion directly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Idea 3</h2>
        <h3>Action Plan</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TODO</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TODO</strong></li>
        </ul>
