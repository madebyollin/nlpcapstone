            <em>Brandon:</em> I installed TensorFlow and
            spaCy. (spaCy is a nice NLP library that we probably
            won't use in our actual project. It's just a shortcut to help get
            started because spaCy makes it super convenient to tokenize sentences into
            lexemes and retrieve vector embeddings for each lexeme.)

            I looked at an example codebase from Google research that uses a Tensorflow
            RNN as a language model on the Penn Treebank dataset. I made
            something similar: a silly RNN that tries to predict the next word
            given 9 words of history. The Penn Treebank model is kind of
            outdated, so I used some more modern Tensorflow
            features, like <tt>dynamic_rnn</tt>.

            It was frustrating to get the model working because I ran out of
            disk quota while installing spaCy's embeddings. Also, training this
            basic RNN is excrutiatingly slow on a machine without GPUs. We will
            definitely need access to GPUs in order to accomplish any deep
            learning projects.
